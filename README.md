# Skillnest_Examen_intento_1
In this repository, you'll find my first try in a Data Scientist course exam offered by Skillnest.
This project consists of different parts:

README.md : The document you're reading right now.
/Data     : The folder which contains the data to process in this exam
/Code     : The folder with the code which uploads, cleans, filters and shows data in graphics.

This project was coded with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and some Seaborn.
